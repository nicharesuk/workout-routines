Notes to Self:

* Deadlift may be better on Monday or Wednesday, Just don't do stiff legged deadlifts on a day you deadlift
* Maybe interesting to try Box squats and floor press if possible
* Possibly add 3x5 on fridays instead of just 1x5? Or 2x3 if you fail the 1x5, then 3x2 if that also starts to fail, after all of this do 5/3/1

* Building the Monolith is the best 5/3/1

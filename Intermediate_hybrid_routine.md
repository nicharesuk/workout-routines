I would really appreciate any advice on this set up for the Texas Method. I'm going to be starting it soon and wanted to add accessories. I have been doing a SS style workout listed here for a while now:

Notes to Self:

* Deadlift may be better on Monday, Just don't do stiff legged deadlifts on a day you deadlift
* Maybe interesting to try Box squats and floor press if possible
* Add more overhead pressing volume
* Possibly add 3x5 on fridays instead of just 1x5? Or 2x3 if you fail the 1x5, then 3x2 if that also starts to fail, after all of this do 5/3/1

* Add OHP accessory volume on Friday if you did Bench press, or just always add it.
* Building the Monolith is the best 5/3/1
